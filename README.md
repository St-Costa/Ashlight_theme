# Ashlight theme

This is a simple theme based on my [website](https://st-costa.github.io/) design.

I focused on a clean layout with an emphasis on good contrast colors for better readability. 

## How to install it
On the right column, find "Release"

Click on the release.

A .zip will be dowloaded.

Unzip the folder.

Put that folder into the folder: `YOUR_WAULT/.obsidian/themes/`

NOTE 1: the folder `.obsidian` is hidden! If you dont see it, you need to play with the settings of your file viewer!

NOTE 2: the folder `themes` might not exist if you dont have any installed theme! In that case, simply create it!

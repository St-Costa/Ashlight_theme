# Ashlight theme

This is a simple theme based on my [website](https://st-costa.github.io/) design.

I focused on a clean layout with an emphasis on good contrast colors for better readability. 

## How to install it
On the right column, find "Release"

Click on the release.

You will find this:

Dowload `manifest.json` and `theme.css`.

Put them in a folder called `Ashlight_theme`

NOTE: is very important that the folder is called like that!

Put the folder `Ashlight_theme` into the folder: `YOUR_WAULT/.obsidian/themes/`

NOTE: the folder `.obsidian` is hidden! If you dont see it, you need to play with the settings of your file viewer!

NOTE: the folder `themes` might not exist if you dont have any installed theme! In that case, simply create it!
